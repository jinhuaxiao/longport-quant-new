# Architecture Overview

## Module Responsibilities
- `longport_quant.config` loads runtime settings and secrets using pydantic.
- `longport_quant.core` wires services, manages lifecycle, and configures logging.
- `longport_quant.data` handles watchlist management, market data streaming via `QuoteContext`, and exposes reusable quote data clients.
- `longport_quant.execution` wraps Longport `TradeContext` inside the async order router and trading client facade.
- `longport_quant.notifications` manages outbound alerts (currently Slack webhook)ã€‚
- `longport_quant.strategy` defines abstract base classes, the signal dispatcher, and orchestrates strategy modules.
- `longport_quant.strategies` hosts concrete user strategies. `SampleStrategy` demonstrates quote handling, while `AutoTradeStrategy` issues basic BUY orders for every watchlist symbol once per trading day.
- `longport_quant.risk` enforces watchlist and limit-based risk checks.
- `longport_quant.portfolio` tracks account state and positions.
- `longport_quant.persistence` provides database session management and ORM models.
- `longport_quant.utils` exposes utility primitives such as the event bus and clock helpers.

## Runtime Flow
1. `core.app.run()` initialises logging, database sessions, market data, order router, portfolio, risk, and strategies.
2. `MarketDataService` builds a shared SDK `Config`, instantiates `QuoteContext`, subscribes to the configured watchlist, and publishes quotes via the in-process `EventBus`.
3. `StrategyManager` dispatches quotes to each loaded strategy. Strategies may emit `Signal` objects which are routed via `OrderRouter`.
4. `RiskEngine` validates orders against watchlist inclusion and per-symbol risk limits before submission.
5. Executed orders and fills are intended to be persisted through `DatabaseSessionManager` and ORM models for downstream analytics.

## Deployment Notes
- Replace the stubbed quote stream with Longport websocket integration and add reconnection logic.
- Expand `PortfolioService` to sync with actual account data via the trading API or database records.
- Define Alembic migrations for ORM models and integrate into CI/CD workflows.
- Instrument logging and metrics sinks (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) for production readiness.
